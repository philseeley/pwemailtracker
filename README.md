# EMail Tracker

An application to send emails to various tracking pages.

For example, if you've temporarily suspended your Iridium Go service, but would still like to log your location to your Predict Wind tracking page.
It does this by writing an email to the Predict Wind tracking address formatted to the required specification: https://help.predictwind.com/en/articles/2884493-how-to-send-manual-gps-tracking-updates-via-email.

Note: 
- on iOS you must install and configure the Apple EMail App with an account. On Android all email clients should be supported.
- on iOS the Auto Close function is unavailable as this is prohibited in the Apple UI guidelines.

If you have any problems or suggestions please log a GitHub issue or email vhpa.developer at gmail.com.
